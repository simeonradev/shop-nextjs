shop-nextjs

shop-nextjs is a Multi-Page Application (MPA) built with Next.js, leveraging server-side rendering (SSR) for optimal performance. It serves as an online shop, developed using JavaScript and utilizing the power of React Query from Tanstack.


In this project, I aimed to create a high-performing and responsive online shop using Next.js, a popular React framework known for its server-side rendering capabilities. Initially, I employed Redux and Redux Saga for state management and asynchronous actions. However, after careful consideration and evaluation, I made the decision to migrate to React Query, a powerful and efficient data-fetching library from Tanstack.

By transitioning to React Query, I streamlined the data management process, allowing for seamless data fetching, caching, and synchronization. This optimization significantly improved the application's performance and reduced complexity, providing a better user experience overall.
